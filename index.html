            <h1> Bangladesh floods - urgent appeal </h1>
            <p>Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk,
                threatened by a high
                risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded into emergency flood
                shelters.
                Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring relief. Roads and homes have been
                submerged, power
                stations are down, and over 380 schools have been closed or impacted.</p>

                <p>The recent flood has caused devastation to many families in various communities throughout Quebec.
                    Despite the heartache
                    it’s been heart-warming to see communities come together in order to support flood victims. Many of
                    us are donating food
                    to help families in need. Several of my clients have asked for advice on the types of non-perishable
                    items they should

                    and what looks like a shallow puddle may be a hole, several feet deep.</p>

            <p>As most people are well aware, the immediate impacts of flooding include loss of human life, damage to

                destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne
                diseases. As
                communication links and infrastructure such as power plants, roads and bridges are damaged and
                disrupted, some economic
                activities may come to a standstill, people are forced to leave their homes and normal life is
                disrupted.imilarly, disruption to industry can lead to loss of livelihoods. Damage to infrastructure
                also causes long-term
                impacts, such as disruptions to supplies of clean water, wastewater treatment, electricity, transport,
                communication,
                education and health care. </p>
